# Analysis of Global GDP and Population Trends

This project analyzes the relationship between **Global GDP** and **Population** using World Bank data.  
It applies data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques to identify regional economic disparities and patterns.

## ðŸ“Š Overview
The analysis explores how population size relates to GDP across different world regions, using scatter, bar, box, and heatmap visualizations.  
It demonstrates statistical measures such as **mean**, **variance**, **skewness**, and **kurtosis** to interpret the data distribution.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **SciPy**

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualizations
1. **Relational Plot:** GDP vs Population (Scatter Plot)  
2. **Categorical Plot:** Average GDP per Region (Bar Plot)  
3. **Statistical Plot:** GDP Distribution by Region (Box Plot)  
4. **Correlation Heatmap:** Relationship between GDP and Population  

## ðŸ“‰ Statistical Insights
- **Mean GDP:** 3016  
- **Variance:** 9.65 million  
- **Skewness:** 1.80 (Right-skewed)  
- **Kurtosis:** 3.45 (Moderately peaked)  
- **Correlation (r):** â‰ˆ 0.35 â†’ Weak positive relationship between GDP and Population  

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion
The study reveals that while population size influences GDP, **economic productivity, industrial development, and infrastructure** play more significant roles.  
Regions like *Europe & Central Asia* and *Latin America & Caribbean* exhibit higher GDP averages, whereas *Africa West* and *Africa East* show lower economic output.  
This project demonstrates effective use of **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis** to uncover real-world economic trends.
